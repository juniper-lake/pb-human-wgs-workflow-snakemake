# PacBio Human WGS Workflow - snakemake implementation

This repo contains a data analysis pipeline to comprehensively detect and prioritize variants in human genomes using PacBio HiFi reads. It consists of three [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflows designed to run sequentially, with PacBio HiFi BAMs or FASTQs as the primary input. 

Documentation for the PacBio Human WGS Workflow (snakemake implementation) is available [here](Tutorial.md).
